SUMMARY = "Whisper speech recognition: Hailo-8 vs i.MX8MP CPU, benchmark and standalone STT"
DESCRIPTION = "Runs the same Whisper-tiny model over the same 10 s audio \
               window on the Hailo-8 AI accelerator (HailoRT) and on the \
               i.MX8MP Cortex-A53 cores (TensorFlow Lite/XNNPACK) as a \
               reference, and reports encoder inferences per second, decoder \
               steps per second and the realtime factor side by side. Also \
               installs whisper-hailo and whisper-cpu: independent \
               speech-to-text commands that run Whisper-tiny on one backend \
               and print a transcript of a WAV file of any length, chunked \
               into the backend's fixed window, or of a live microphone \
               recording via -m/--mic (press Enter to stop early, via \
               sounddevice/PortAudio). \
               \
               There is deliberately no i.MX8MP NPU backend: measured, the \
               NPU (VeriSilicon VIP8000) is slower than the CPU on this \
               model, because it is a quantized-CNN engine and Whisper's \
               attention/layernorm ops don't map onto it -- see README.md."

# The demo degrades gracefully: a backend whose runtime is missing is reported

# (and the libportaudio it dlopens, via its portaudio-v19 RDEPENDS) is only
# needed for -m/--mic, hence recommend rather than require it.
